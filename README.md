# user's ssg
This is a fork of [ssg](https://www.romanzolotarev.com/ssg.html) which is a static website generator.
I have patched ssg to include landing page generation (with article list), rss feed generation, floating html in markdown files and better title support.

## Licence
This project is licenced under the ISC licence just like the original project.
